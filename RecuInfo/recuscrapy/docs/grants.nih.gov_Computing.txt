       The NIH is interested in promoting a broad base of research
          and development of technologies in biomedical computing, informatics, and Big
          Data Science that will support rapid progress in areas of scientific
          opportunity in biomedical research.  It is expected that this research and
          development is conducted in the context of important biomedical and
          behavioral research problems.  As such, applications are intended to develop
          enabling technologies that could apply to the interests of most NIH
          Institutes and Centers and range from basic biomedicine and including research
          to all relevant organ systems and diseases. Major themes of research include
          collaborative environments; data integration; analysis and modeling
          methodologies; and novel computer science and statistical approaches.  New
          opportunities are also emerging as large and complex data sets are becoming
          increasingly available to the research community.  This initiative aims to
          address biomedical research areas in biomedical computing, informatics, and
          Big Data science through the early stage development of new software, tools
          and related resources, as well as the fundamental research (e.g.,
          methodologies and approaches) leading up to that development.

    Section I. Funding Opportunity Description
   </div>
   <p class="regulartext">
    This Funding Opportunity
    Announcement (FOA) encourages research projects that focus on early stage
    research and development of technologies in biomedical computing, informatics,
    and Big Data science.  The FOA is coordinated by the NIH Big Data Initiative
    (BD2K) and the Biomedical Information Science and Technology Initiative (BISTI)
    committees. Through this and related opportunities, Institutes and Centers at
    the NIH offer support for: fundamental research (e.g., methodologies and
    approaches) in biomedical computing, informatics, and Big Data science;
    development of new software, tools and related resources; and applications of
    computational technologies to a particular domain area(s) in biomedical
    research. Information on these programs and related funding opportunities from
    participating Institutes and Centers of NIH can be found at
    <a href="http://www.bd2k.nih.gov">
     http://www.bd2k.nih.gov
    </a>
    and
    <a href="http://www.bisti.nih.gov/">
     http://www.bisti.nih.gov/
    </a>
    .  Note that in this document, the
    term “biomedical” will be used in the broadest sense to include biological,
    biomedical, behavioral, social, environmental, and clinical studies that relate
    to understanding health and disease.  Applicants are reminded to carefully
    check that the proposed research lies in the mission of the participant
    Institutes and Centers of the initiative.
   </p>
   <p class="regulartext">
    This FOA is focused on early stage research and software
    development which is understood to make use of a more sandbox-oriented software
    development environment.  This means that the engagement of end users in the
    development cycle is less critical.  Potential users may be basic or
    translational biomedical researchers, experimental scientists, behavioral
    scientists, social scientists, clinicians, software developers, or
    computational scientists.  Applications for hardening of software / technology
    that already has a proven audience of users will be accepted under a separate
    FOA,

   <p class="regulartext">
    In addition to applications for funding in biomedical
    computing and informatics research that have been accepted under previous BISTI
    funding opportunity announcements, this announcement acknowledges new
    opportunities are also emerging as large and complex data sets are becoming
    increasingly available to the research community. While the biomedical research
    enterprise is producing increasingly large amounts of digital data, it has not
    yet fully capitalized on the transformative opportunities that these data
    provide.  As stated by the Data and Informatics Working Group (DIWG) of the
    Advisory Committee to the NIH Director, "Colossal changes in biomedical
    research technologies and methods have shifted the bottleneck in scientific
    productivity from data production to data management, communication, and
    interpretation." (
    <a href="http://acd.od.nih.gov/Data%20and%20Informatics%20Working%20Group%20Report.pdf">
     http://acd.od.nih.gov/Data%20and%20Informatics%20Working%20Group%20Report.pdf
    </a>
    ). 
    In this context, the term "Big Data Science" is meant to capture the
    opportunities and address the challenges facing all biomedical researchers in
    releasing, accessing, managing, analyzing, and integrating datasets of diverse
    data types.  Such data types may include imaging, phenotypic, molecular
    (including –omics), physiological, anatomical, clinical, behavioral,
    environmental, and many other types of biological and biomedical data.  They
    may also include data generated for other purposes (e.g., social media, search
    histories, and cell phone data).
   </p>
   <p class="regulartext">
    Investigators may target one or multiple of the following
    four themes of biomedical computing, informatics, and Big Data science that

    <strong>
     Research
    Strategy:
    </strong>
    Investigators should clearly state the long term
    goals of the particular technology and justify the particular goals that will
    be being developed through this early-stage FOA. Applications are expected to
    address the generalizability of the software, the scientific validation of
    implementations, and self-evaluation according to the following guidelines:
   </p>
   <p class="regulartext">
    <em>
     Generalizable,
    scalable, extensible, and interoperable:
    </em>
    Given the expanding needs
    in biomedical research for advances in a variety of areas of biomedical computing
    and informatics, the technologies proposed under this announcement should
    address a significant biocomputational research question and, as appropriate,
    should be generalizable, scalable, extensible, and interoperable.  The
    applicant should also provide plans for the dissemination of products of the
    project, including software, tools and related resources, to the relevant
    research and user communities. The biomedical computational and informatics
    research and technology development proposed should be forward thinking, fill a
    critical gap, address an area of need or projected need, and seek to exceed the
    current state of the art.
   </p>
   <p class="regulartext">
    <em>
     Functionality.
    </em>
    Applicants should describe the different kinds of functionality and
    how the application scientists will be involved during early stages of
    development. Applicants should also describe the different kinds of interfaces
    and functionalities that apply to different stakeholder and user communities.
   </p>
   <p class="regulartext">
    <em>
     Scientific
    Validation:
    </em>
    Each application should contain a brief plan for
    validation of the scientific software, tools and related resources.  This plan
    should provide the organizing principles by which scientific validation will be
    conducted.
   </p>
   <p class="regulartext">
    <em>
     Evaluation:
    </em>
    The application should include a plan for evaluating the quality and utility of
    the new software, tools and related resources being developed through this
    initiative and the plan should focus on the early stage of the product, since
    it is anticipated that the product will be in early stages.  Criteria for
    evaluation of products may include adequacy, trustworthiness, authenticity,
    integrity, availability, documentation, and transparency. Specific examples of
    evaluative information could include, as appropriate, the quality of
    publications citing uses, tracking the number of users, background/training of
    the users, requests for services, successful use of the products, number of
    students, use of training materials, the ability to extend the utility of tools
    through collaborations with other investigators, etc. The research community
    being served will have expectations that could be documented through mechanisms
    such as user feedback, letters of support, etc. Quantifiable measures of
    results and success are important and should be built in as:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Short-term internal metrics (for ongoing improvement);
    </li>
    <li>
     Long-term objective metrics (to gauge impact of use on the
      scientific field).
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p class="regulartext">
    Methods for assessment, such as user registration, should
    not be so onerous that they compromise the use of the investigator’s resources.
   </p>
   <p class="regulartext">
    <em>
     Data
    and metadata standards:
    </em>
    An important goal of the BD2K and BISTI
    Initiatives is to promote a culture where a large body of annotated and
    shareable data is available online to the broad biomedical research community.
    The development and use of data and metadata standards are critical for
    achieving this goal. The NIH has a number of efforts to stimulate the creation
    and support of community-based approaches to develop such standards.
    Investigators may participate in the development of data standards, and may
    serve as early testers and adopters of community-developed standards. The
    application should include a plan for how the proposed R01 will manage data and
    metadata standards and formats.  Applicants should, as appropriate, i) engage
    with community-based standard and format development activities, and ii) apply
    community-based standards and formats to the data and metadata that the R01 is
    using for its research.
   </p>
   <p class="regulartext">
    <em>
     Use of
    Common Data Elements in NIH-funded Research:
    </em>
    NIH encourages the use
    of common data elements (CDEs) in basic, clinical, and applied research,
    patient registries, and other human subject research to facilitate broader and
    more effective use of data and advance research across studies.  CDEs are data
    elements that have been identified and defined for use in multiple data sets
    across different studies.  Use of CDEs can facilitate data sharing and
    standardization to improve data quality and enable data integration from
    multiple studies and sources, including electronic health records.  NIH ICs
    have identified CDEs for many clinical domains (e.g., neurological disease),
    types of studies (e.g. genome-wide association studies (GWAS)), types of
    outcomes (e.g., patient-reported outcomes), and patient registries (e.g., the
    Global Rare Diseases Patient Registry and Data Repository).  NIH has
    established a “Common Data Element (CDE) Resource Portal"
    (http://cde.nih.gov/) to assist investigators in identifying NIH-supported CDEs
    when developing protocols, case report forms, and other instruments for data
    collection.  The Portal provides guidance about and access to NIH-supported CDE
    initiatives and other tools and resources for the appropriate use of CDEs and
    data standards in NIH-funded research.  Investigators are encouraged to consult
    the Portal and describe in their applications any use they will make of
    NIH-supported CDEs in their projects.

    A software dissemination plan, with appropriate
    timelines, is expected to be included in the application. There is no
    prescribed single license for software produced through grants responding to
    this announcement. However, NIH does have goals for software dissemination, and
    reviewers will be instructed to evaluate the dissemination plan relative to
    these goals:
   </p>
   <p class="regulartext">
    1. The software should be freely available to biomedical
    researchers and educators in the non-profit sector, such as institutions of
    education, research institutions, and government laboratories.
   </p>
   <p class="regulartext">
    2. The terms of software availability should permit the
    dissemination and commercialization of enhanced or customized versions of the
    software, or incorporation of the software or pieces of it into other software
    packages.
   </p>
   <p class="regulartext">
    3. To preserve utility to the community, the software should
    be transferable such that another individual or team can continue development
    in the event that the original investigators are unwilling or unable to do so.
   </p>
   <p class="regulartext">
    4. The terms of software availability should include the
    ability of researchers to modify the source code and to share modifications
    with other colleagues. An applicant should take responsibility for creating the
    original and subsequent official versions of a piece of software.
   </p>
   <p class="regulartext">
    5. To further enhance the potential impact of their
    software, applicants may consider proposing a plan to manage and disseminate
    the improvements or customizations of their tools and resources by others. This
    application for funding may include a plan to incorporate the enhancements into
    the official core software, may involve the creation of an infrastructure for
    plug-ins, or may describe some other solution.
