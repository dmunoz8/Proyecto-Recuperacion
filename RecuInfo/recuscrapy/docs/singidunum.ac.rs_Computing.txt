                 Introduces the concepts and practice of software architecture-what a system is designed to do, and on how its components are meant to interact with each other. An architecture is an abstract view, distinct from the details of implementation, algorithm, and data representation. Its creation is the first step in designing a system with properties desired by customers, end users, developers, maintainers, and other interested parties. It covers essential technical topics for specifying and validating a system, and emphasizes the importance of the business context in which large systems are designed. Enhancing both technical and organizational discussions, key points are illuminated by substantial case studies and the Software Engineering Institute. Practicing software engineers who wish to understand both the technical basis of software architecture and the business and organizational forces that are acting on them Technical managers who wish to understand how software architecture can help them to supervise the construction of systems more effectively and improve their organizations Students in computer science or software engineering who might use this book as supplemental reading in a first or second software engineering course.
